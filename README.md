# NGAG

The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills after starting to code again using HTML5 and CSS3. I made sure to utilise flex-box and media queires for this project, and to make sure  I get a clean and concise project. 

There are a few things I wish I could have implemented such as flex-box shrink. Hopefully I will get to implement this on my next project. 

This project has some imperfections such as layout on the hero image when it is scaled down to a specific pixel however I tried to make it as clean as possible and make sure it is user friendly.
